## Branch Protection
The `main` branch is protected from being pushed to. <br>
All changes must be made with a branch and a pull request. <br>
**ALL PULL REQUESTS** must be reviewed by at least **3** other members of the team before being merged into `main`. <br>
When a pull request is ready for review, please add all other contributors to request a review. <br>
You can also enable Auto-Merge to automatically merge it when approved. <br>

### Pull request blocking
There is a github bot that will prevent pull requests from being merged if something is wrong. <br>
An example is leaking secrets. <br>

### I accidentally committed to main
If you accidentally commit to main, make a new branch from your current main. <br>
Push this branch to github. <br>
Then, reset your local main to the remote main. <br>
You can then create a pull request to merge your branch into main (If you're ready) <br>
